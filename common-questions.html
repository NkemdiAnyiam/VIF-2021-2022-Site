                    Though classes are not canceled, Career Fairs can be considered an excused absence under Rule 07 of
                    the
                    Texas A&M Attendance code, as they fall under the following section:
                  <p class="indent">
                    7.2.2.6 Mandatory interviews for permanent, full-time employment or full-time internships (including
                    those that are part of a cooperative education program) that have a duration of at least 10 weeks,
                    provided that such interviews are related to the student’s academic program and provided that the
                    interviews are fixed date by employer policy and cannot be rescheduled. A student may not request
                    excused absences for employment or internship interviews for more than one scheduled class meeting
                    in
                    one academic term.
                  </p>
                  <p class="indent">
                    7.2.2.8 Participation in an activity appearing on the university authorized activity list.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                    However, there is a maximum of one (1) excused absence for interviews or employment related
                    activities.
                    Please plan your day accordingly so you don’t miss the opportunity to speak with company
                    representatives. Some professors may allow students to attend during regularly scheduled class time.
                    Check with your professor regarding their policy for attending the Industry Fair. Make sure to
                    notify
                    your professors ahead of time.
