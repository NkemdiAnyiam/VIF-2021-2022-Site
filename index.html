              Because of continuing concerns with the Pandemic, we will be holding a Virtual Fair this year. The Fair
              will take place Friday, February 25, 2022. Times are TBD, and they will be posted when finalized.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Viz Industry Fair is run by a student run committee. These dedicated students, with focuses in Game
              Development, Animation, and Interactive Media, such as UI/UX and web design, reach out to companies,
              create the Fair content and website, and run the social media campaign of the V.I.F.
            </p>

            <p>
              Along with this year's fair, The V.I.F. Committee has also put together several other events throughout
              the school year. These include industry speakers, portfolio reviews, mock interviews, and resume reviews.
            </p>

            <p>We look forward to seeing you at our many events and the fair!</p>
