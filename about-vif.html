            The Viz Industry Fair is an opportunity for students interested in Animation, Game Development, and Graphics
            &amp; Interactive Technologies to both connect with prospective employers working in high level positions in some
            of today's leading Industries and receive professional feedback on their work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because of continuing concerns with the Pandemic, we will be holding a Virtual Fair this year. The Fair will
            take place Friday, February 25, 2022. Times are TBD, and will be posted when finalized.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Viz Industry Fair is run by a student run committee. These dedicated students, with focuses in Game
            Development, Animation, and Interactive Media, such as UI/UX and web design, reach out to companies, create
            the Fair content and website, and run the social media campaign of the V.I.F.
          </p>

          <p>Along with this year's fair, The V.I.F. Committee has also put together several other events throughout the
            school year. These include industry speakers, portfolio reviews, mock interviews, and resume reviews.
